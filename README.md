Ajax Problem in Joomla! 3
While nigrating from Joomla! 3.10.12 I get the problem notice that the migration blocks at 90 % and everything stops because of Ajax. Ajax uses extensions and components in Joomla1 but I don't know which one or even more.
How can I get rid of this problem? In Google I find a few more people who have this problem but no real solution.
So let's try it here
I hope someone here knows this problem and has a solution.
